# EDA_Descriptives_Tables

Consolidating the 'Easy-EDA-in-R' and 'Descriptives-and-Tables' repositories, with updates for newer R materials. 

The goal is to have one repository which covers:
- Initial inspection of data frames (e.g., you've imported some data or been handed some data, and you want to verify a good import or orient yourself on the data fram).
- EDA - what's the nature of the data (i.e., more statistically oriented than the initial inspection).
- Tables and descriptive statistics, in a nicely organized manner.
